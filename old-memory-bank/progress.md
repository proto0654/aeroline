# Progress

## What Works ✅
- ✅ **COMPLETED**: Unified global modal system using Vue 3, Pinia, and `GlobalModalHost.vue`.
- ✅ **COMPLETED**: All core modal windows work consistently across all pages (login, become client, email send, create/edit/delete sender/receiver).
- ✅ **COMPLETED**: All import errors resolved.
- ✅ **COMPLETED**: All main and submenu pages exist and are linked.
- ✅ **COMPLETED**: Mobile menu: two-level structure, toggles, animated SVG arrow.
- ✅ **COMPLETED**: Placeholder pages for every menu item.
- ✅ **COMPLETED**: JS logic for toggling submenus in mobile menu.
- ✅ **COMPLETED**: Service acts page with List.js sorting and pagination (Vue integration pending review).
- ✅ **COMPLETED**: Refactoring tables on `senders-receivers.html` and `service-acts.html` to use the reusable Vue 3 component `EasyDataTableWrapper.vue` based on `vue3-easy-data-table`, replacing List.js. Pagination color and spacing are styled using `theme-color` prop and CSS variables.
- ✅ **COMPLETED**: DaisyUI theme system implementation.
- ✅ **COMPLETED**: All pages use consistent modal structure (div-based, not dialog).
- ✅ **UPDATED**: Improved styling for V-Calendar date selection in `assets/css/main.css`.
- Vite updated to 6.3.5; Handlebars processing appears functional with deprecation warnings.
- ✅ **COMPLETED**: Integrated Vue 3 Date Range Picker component-island on `service-acts.html` and `news.html`.
- ✅ **COMPLETED**: "Modal was cancelled" console errors eliminated by switching `globalModal` to always resolve promises with `success` or `cancelled` flags.
- ✅ **COMPLETED**: Login button logic moved to `global-ui.js` for universal availability.
- ✅ **COMPLETED**: News page modal refactored to use unified global Vue 3 modal system.
- ✅ **COMPLETED**: Old static news modal HTML removed from `news.html`.
- ✅ **COMPLETED**: `assets/vue/components/modals/NewsDetailModal.vue` created for news details.
- ✅ **COMPLETED**: `assets/js/modules/news-page.js` updated to use `window.globalModalStore.openModal` with `NewsDetailModal` and correct parameter passing.
- ✅ **COMPLETED**: `assets/vue/stores/globalModal.js` updated to include `size` parameter in `openModal` and manage it in state.
- ✅ **COMPLETED**: `assets/vue/components/GlobalModalHost.vue` updated to dynamically apply DaisyUI size classes (`w-auto max-w-[calc(100vw-8rem)]` for `'large'`, `max-w-md` for `'default'`) to modal-box.
- ✅ **COMPLETED**: Replaced news slider/carousel on the home page with a grid of the latest 3 news items using a Vue component (`HomePageNews.vue`) and integrated with the global modal system for details.
- ✅ **COMPLETED**: Added 'isNew' indicator (SVG) to home page news cards.
- ✅ **COMPLETED**: Changed the 'Стать клиентом' button on index.html to a direct link to user-create.html.
- ✅ **COMPLETED**: Removed the JavaScript code in assets/js/page-entrypoints/index.js that triggered the 'Стать клиентом' modal.
- ✅ **COMPLETED**: Deleted the BecomeClientForm.vue component as it is no longer used.

## Modal System Status ✅
- **Implementation**: Unified global modal system using Vue 3, Pinia, and DaisyUI.
- **Host Component**: `GlobalModalHost.vue` centrally manages modal structure and behavior.
- **State Management**: Pinia store (`globalModal.js`) manages modal state (open/close, component, props, size).
- **Structure**: All modals utilize DaisyUI classes for consistent styling.
- **Behavior**: Consistent close on Escape, backdrop click, close buttons. Promise-based results (success/cancelled) instead of rejections for dismissals.
- **Sizes**: Support for small, default (`max-w-md`), large (`w-auto max-w-[calc(100vw-8rem)]`), full sizes.
- **Pages**: index.html, profile.html, news.html, service-acts.html, senders-receivers.html
- **JavaScript**: All relevant modules updated to use global modal store.
- **Testing**: `modal-test.html` (if still relevant) created for comprehensive testing.

## Progress Summary

- **What Works:**
    - Vue 3 setup with Vite, Pinia, DaisyUI, Tailwind CSS is functional.
    - Global modal system (`GlobalModalHost.vue`) is implemented and works correctly with Vue components like `NewsDetailModal.vue`.
    - Date range filtering for news (`NewsPageContainer.vue`, `DateRangeFilter.vue`, `DateRangePickerVue.vue`) is successfully implemented and filters news based on the selected range, including initial default range setting and live updates/reset.
    - News data is loaded from `assets/data/news.json`.
    - Basic news grid display (`NewsGrid.vue`) and card rendering (`NewsCard.vue`) match the original HTML structure and styling.
    - ✅ **COMPLETED**: The home page news block is now a functional Vue component displaying the latest 3 news and using the global modal for details, including the 'isNew' indicator.
    - ✅ **COMPLETED**: The 'Стать клиентом' button on index.html now directly links to user-create.html, and the associated modal logic and component have been removed.
    - ✅ **COMPLETED**: Tables on `senders-receivers.html` and `service-acts.html` have been refactored to use the reusable Vue 3 component `EasyDataTableWrapper.vue` based on `vue3-easy-data-table`, providing unified sorting, filtering, and pagination.

- **What's Left to Build:**
    - Vue-based pagination component (`NewsPagination.vue`) needs to be fully integrated and handle page changes, including updating displayed news and scrolling.
    - Integration with the real Bitrix CMS API for news data (future phase).
    - Refactoring of other pages/modules to Vue 3.

- **Current Status:** Core functionality (data loading, filtering, modal display) for the news page refactoring MVP is complete. Pagination is the primary remaining task for this phase. Tables on `senders-receivers.html` and `service-acts.html` are successfully refactored to use `EasyDataTableWrapper.vue`.

- **Known Issues:** None critical for the current scope. Minor styling adjustments might be needed during final polish.
