## Modal System Status ✅

- **Testing**: modal-test.html created for comprehensive testing

## What's Left to Build
- Accessibility improvements for menu
- Further animation polish (if needed)
- Ongoing UI/UX refinements
- Move remaining styles to main stylesheet (low priority)
- ➡️ **Starting Vue 3 Integration (Personal Account MVP)**
- ➡️ **First Vue Component: Date Range Picker** (using mock JSON via bundler)
- Replace vanilla-calendar-pro with Vue 3 Date Range Picker component-island on `service-acts.html` and `news.html`.
- Implement and integrate other Vue 3 components for Personal Account MVP features.

## Current Status
- ✅ Project matches design for navigation and menu
- ✅ All navigation points are functional
- ✅ Modal system fully unified and working
- ✅ All import errors resolved
- ✅ All functionality tested and verified
- ✅ Ready for new features or maintenance
- Vite updated to 6.3.5, Vue 3 dependencies added.
- Vue 3 Date Range Picker component integrated as island on service-acts.html and news.html.

## Known Issues (Resolved)
- ~~Modal behavior consistency across pages~~ ✅ FIXED
- ~~Import errors with deleted modal files~~ ✅ FIXED
- ~~Inconsistent modal structures~~ ✅ FIXED
- ~~Button click handlers not working~~ ✅ FIXED

## Remaining Minor Issues
- Minor animation polish may be needed
- Accessibility/keyboard navigation for mobile menu
- Some styles could be moved to main stylesheet (optional)
- Deprecation warnings from vite-plugin-handlebars with Vite 6.3.5.

## Base Project Structure ✅
- ✅ Base project structure
- ✅ Main pages
- ✅ Build system
- ✅ Tailwind-based styling
- ✅ DaisyUI integration
- ✅ Unified modal system
- `assets/vue/`: New directory for Vue 3 components, stores, views, etc.
- `assets/vue/components/DateRangePickerVue.vue`: Vue 3 Date Range Picker component.
- `assets/vue/entrypoints/lk-datepicker.js`: Entry point for mounting the Vue date picker component.

## Reusable Patterns & Modules ✅

### Vue Date Picker Island

- Created basic Vue 3 component wrapper (`DateRangePickerVue.vue`).
- Created entry point (`lk-datepicker.js`) for mounting the component as an island.
- Added container divs and script tags to `service-acts.html` and `news.html` for mounting.
- **Next:** Adapt `service-acts-page.js` and `news-page.js` to use the new Vue component, considering the Vite build process. 

## Progress

**What Works:**
- Vite build command runs without the previous `Cannot read properties of undefined` error.
- JS and Vue entry points are bundled and outputted with hashes in `docs/assets/js/` and `docs/assets/vue/entrypoints/` (structure is preserved for these).
- CSS is processed by PostCSS and outputted with hashes (though its location needs final verification).
- HTML files are processed by Handlebars and placed in the `docs` root.
- The old `vite.build-js.config.js` is removed.
- The `cpx` copying command is removed from the build script.
- ✅ **FIXED:** Asset folder structure issue resolved using explicit categorization by file extension.
- ✅ **IMPLEMENTED:** Images, CSS, fonts, data files, and JS files now correctly go to their respective subdirectories in `docs/assets/`.

**What's Left to Build/Fix:**
- ~~Verify and Fix Asset Folder Structure~~ ✅ **FIXED** with explicit extension-based categorization
- **Update HTML Links:** The `updateHtmlFilesPlugin` needs to correctly update links in HTML files to point to the new hashed asset filenames located in their correct subfolders within `docs/assets/`. (This needs verification once the asset structure is fixed).
- **Review `publicDir`:** Confirm if any static assets are placed in `public/` that need to be handled differently (currently `publicDir` is set to `false`, assuming all relevant assets are under `assets/`).

**Current Status:** The build runs successfully with the correct asset output structure. Assets are now properly categorized and placed in their respective subdirectories inside `docs/assets/` based on file type:
- Images (`.jpg`, `.png`, `.svg`, etc.) → `assets/img/`
- CSS files → `assets/css/`
- Fonts → `assets/fonts/`
- Data files → `assets/data/`
- JS entry points → `assets/js/`
- JS chunks → `assets/js/chunks/`

**Known Issues:**
- ~~Asset files (images, SVG, CSS processed by Vite) are currently placed in the root of `docs/assets/` instead of their respective subfolders (e.g., `img/`, `css/`) from the source `assets/` directory.~~ ✅ **FIXED**
