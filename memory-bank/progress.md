# Progress

## What Works ✅

- ✅ **COMPLETED**: DaisyUI theme system implemented.
- ✅ **COMPLETED**: All pages use a consistent modal structure (div-based, not dialog).

- ✅ **COMPLETED**: `assets/js/modules/news-page.js` updated to use `window.globalModalStore.openModal` with `NewsDetailModal` and correct parameter passing.
- ✅ **COMPLETED**: `assets/vue/stores/globalModal.js` updated to include `size` parameter in `openModal` and manage it in state.
- ✅ **COMPLETED**: `assets/vue/components/GlobalModalHost.vue` updated to dynamically apply DaisyUI size classes (`w-auto max-w-[calc(100vw-8rem)]` for `'large'`, `max-w-md` for `'default'`) to the modal-box.
- ✅ **COMPLETED**: Replaced news slider/carousel on the main page with a grid of the latest 3 news using a Vue component (`HomePageNews.vue`) and integration with the global modal system for details.

## Modal System Status ✅
- **Implementation**: Unified global modal system using Vue 3, Pinia, and DaisyUI.
- **Host Component**: `GlobalModalHost.vue` centrally manages modal structure and behavior.
- **State Management**: Pinia store (`globalModal.js`) manages modal state (open/close, component, props, size).
- **Structure**: All modals use DaisyUI classes for consistent styling.
- **Behavior**: Consistent closing on Escape, backdrop click, close buttons. Promise-based results (success/cancellation) instead of rejections for cancellation.
- **Sizes**: Support for small, default (`max-w-md`), large (`w-auto max-w-[calc(100vw-8rem)]`), full sizes.
- **Pages**: index.html, profile.html, news.html, service-acts.html, senders-receivers.html
- **JavaScript**: All relevant modules updated to use the global modal store.
- **Testing**: `modal-test.html` (if still relevant) created for comprehensive testing.

## What's Left to Do
- Continue refactoring existing native JavaScript forms and dynamic elements into Vue 3 components.

## Progress Summary

- **What's Working:**
    - Vue 3 setup with Vite, Pinia, DaisyUI, Tailwind CSS is functional.
    - Global modal system (`GlobalModalHost.vue`) is implemented and correctly works with Vue components like `NewsDetailModal.vue`.
    - Date range filtering for news (`NewsPageContainer.vue`, `DateRangeFilter.vue`, `DateRangePickerVue.vue`) is successfully implemented and filters news based on selected range, including setting a default initial range and live updates/clearing.
    - News data is loaded from `assets/data/news.json`.
    - Basic news grid display (`NewsGrid.vue`) and card rendering (`NewsCard.vue`) match the original HTML structure and styling.
    - ✅ **COMPLETED**: News block on the main page is now a functional Vue component displaying the latest 3 news and using the global modal for details, including an 'isNew' indicator.
    - ✅ **COMPLETED**: 'Become a Client' button on index.html now directly links to user-create.html, and related modal logic and component were removed.
    - ✅ **COMPLETED**: Tables on `senders-receivers.html` and `service-acts.html` have been refactored to use a reusable Vue 3 component `EasyDataTableWrapper.vue` based on `vue3-easy-data-table`, ensuring unified sorting, filtering, and pagination.

- **What's Left to Do:**
    - Vue pagination component (`NewsPagination.vue`) needs to be fully integrated and handle page changes, including updating displayed news and scrolling.
    - Integration with a real Bitrix CMS API for news data (future phase).
    - Refactoring of other pages/modules to Vue 3.

- **Current Status:** Core functionality (data loading, filtering, modal display) for the MVP news page refactoring is complete. Pagination is the main remaining task for this phase. Tables on `senders-receivers.html` and `service-acts.html` successfully refactored to use `EasyDataTableWrapper.vue`.

- **Known Issues:** No critical issues for the current scope. Minor styling adjustments might be needed during final polishing.
