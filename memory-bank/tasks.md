# Current Tasks

## ✅ COMPLETED: Integration of Vue Date Picker Library in Calculator

**Task:** Integrate Vue date picker library into calculator components where dates are needed.

**Completed Work:**

1. **Created Single Date Picker Component** (`assets/vue/components/DatePickerVue.vue`):

   - Based on `vue-datepicker-next` library (same as existing `DateRangePickerVue.vue`)
   - Supports single date selection with Russian localization
   - Props: `initialDate`, `placeholder`, `closeOnSelect`, `minDate`, `maxDate`
   - Events: `update:date`, `date-select`, `clear-selection`
   - Methods: `clearSelection()` exposed via `defineExpose`

2. **Updated DeliveryPointForm.vue**:
   - Replaced standard HTML `<input type="date">` with new `DatePickerVue` component
   - Added proper form control wrapper with label styling
   - Integrated with existing form validation and data flow
   - Maintains compatibility with existing calculator logic

**Technical Details:**

- Uses same `vue-datepicker-next` library as existing `DateRangePickerVue.vue`
- Consistent styling with DaisyUI/Tailwind classes
- Proper integration with VeeValidate form system
- Maintains reactive data flow in calculator components

**Files Modified:**

- `assets/vue/components/DatePickerVue.vue` (new)
- `assets/vue/components/pages/calculator/DeliveryPointForm.vue` (updated)

## ✅ COMPLETED: Advanced Tariff System with Delivery Time and Date Integration

**Task:** Enhance tariff system to include delivery time calculations, date constraints, and temporal availability checking.

**Completed Work:**

1. **Enhanced Tariff Configuration** (`assets/data/calculator-data.json`):

   - Added `deliveryTime` object to each tariff with delivery time calculation formulas
   - Added `minAdvanceBookingDays` and `maxAdvanceBookingDays` to availability constraints
   - Created new **Cargo-Срочный** (Urgent) tariff for same-day/next-day delivery
   - Added delivery time calculation rules to global configuration

2. **Updated Calculator Logic** (`assets/vue/components/pages/calculator/CalculatorPage.vue`):

   - Added `calculateDeliveryTime()` function for time-based calculations
   - Added `calculateMinDeliveryDate()` function for minimum delivery date calculation
   - Enhanced `checkTariffAvailability()` to include date-based constraints
   - Updated `calculateTariffCost()` to include delivery time information in results
   - Modified `calculationResult` to work with new tariff structure

3. **Enhanced Results Display** (`assets/vue/components/pages/calculator/CalculationResult.vue`):

   - Added delivery time information display for each tariff
   - Shows minimum delivery date calculation
   - Includes distance information in tariff details
   - Added `formatDate()` utility function for date formatting

4. **Updated Documentation** (`memory-bank/tariff-documentation.md`):
   - Documented new delivery time system and formulas
   - Added test scenarios for date-based constraints
   - Explained advance booking limitations
   - Added technical documentation for new fields and functions

**Key Features Added:**

- **Delivery Time Calculation**: Each tariff has formula `baseDays + (distance × daysPerKm)` limited by `maxDays`
- **Date Constraints**: Tariffs can require minimum/maximum advance booking periods
- **Minimum Delivery Date**: Automatically calculated based on departure date and delivery time
- **Urgent Tariff**: New express tariff for same-day delivery with geographical and weight restrictions
- **Enhanced Display**: Shows delivery time estimates and minimum delivery dates in UI

**Technical Implementation:**

- Time calculations based on real distance between cities
- Date validation prevents impossible delivery scenarios
- Tariff availability automatically filters based on temporal constraints
- Results include comprehensive delivery time information

**Files Modified:**

- `assets/data/calculator-data.json` (enhanced with delivery time data)
- `assets/vue/components/pages/calculator/CalculatorPage.vue` (added time calculations)
- `assets/vue/components/pages/calculator/CalculationResult.vue` (enhanced display)
- `memory-bank/tariff-documentation.md` (comprehensive update)

**Next Steps:**

- Test the enhanced system with various date scenarios
- Consider adding delivery time warnings/notifications
- Potentially add delivery time guarantees or penalties
