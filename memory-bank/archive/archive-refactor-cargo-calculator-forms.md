# Archive: Refactoring Cargo Calculator Forms

## Task ID: refactor-cargo-calculator-forms

## Date: 2024-05-27

## Summary of Work Done:

This session focused on a comprehensive refactoring of the cargo calculator forms to improve state management, data persistence across different modes, and user experience.

### Key Issues Addressed:

1.  **Global Parameters to Per-Place Parameters**: Initially, cargo parameters (description, declared value, packaging, self-marking, dangerous goods, temperature control) were applied globally. This was refactored to apply these parameters to each individual package/place, enabling granular control.
2.  **State Persistence across Modes/Tabs**: Addressed the issue where data for specific cargo parameters (description, declared value, packaging, checkboxes) were not retained when switching between "Places individually" and "Total weight/volume" modes, or between individual place tabs.
3.  **Quantity Counter System**: Replaced the previous "duplicate" functionality with a quantity counter system, allowing users to specify multiple identical packages, reflected in tab labels (e.g., "1 place (×20)"). All calculations now correctly account for quantity.
4.  **Detailed Calculation Breakdown**: Enhanced the calculation result display to provide an extremely detailed breakdown, showing individual place calculations, costs per place, multipliers, and tariff coefficients.
5.  **VeeValidate Interference**: Identified and resolved conflicts caused by VeeValidate's caching mechanism in dynamically rendered form components, which led to incorrect display of saved data. This was resolved by migrating to custom, simpler form components.
6.  **Improved Input Field Formatting**: Implemented intelligent formatting for numerical input fields (length, width, height, weight, declared value) in the `CalculatorTextInput` component. When a field loses focus, it now displays with a descriptive prefix (e.g., "Длина"), the value, and units (e.g., "см"). When focused, it reverts to a clean numerical value for easy editing, with text automatically selected.

### Files Modified & Key Changes:

- **`assets/vue/components/pages/calculator/CalculatorPage.vue`**:

  - Updated calculation functions (`checkTariffAvailability`, `calculateTariffCost`) to correctly process per-place parameters and quantities.
  - Adjusted `formData` initialization to reflect the per-place structure for cargo.

- **`assets/vue/components/pages/calculator/CargoParamsForm.vue`**:

  - Reworked to manage two independent states: `individualState` (for multiple packages) and `totalState` (for combined weight/volume).
  - Removed data copying logic between modes; switching modes now only changes the active view, preserving data in both states.
  - Improved `watch` handlers for `props.modelValue` to ensure robust synchronization of both `individualState` and `totalState` from the parent component.

- **`assets/vue/components/pages/calculator/CargoPlaceForm.vue`**:

  - Removed `vee-validate` related code and references to global `TextInput`, `SelectInput`, `CheckboxInput` components.
  - Integrated new, custom `CalculatorTextInput`, `CalculatorSelectInput`, and `CalculatorCheckboxInput` components.
  - Applied new `displayPrefix`, `displaySuffix`, and `showFormattedWhenBlurred` props to `CalculatorTextInput` for enhanced UX.
  - Simplified internal `ref` and `watch` logic for better predictability.

- **`assets/vue/components/pages/calculator/CargoPlacesTabs.vue`**:

  - Removed the `key` binding from `CargoPlaceForm` to prevent unnecessary component re-renders and ensure smooth state preservation when switching tabs.
  - Enhanced `createDefaultPlace` to ensure new places are fully initialized with all required fields.

- **`assets/vue/components/pages/calculator/CalculatorTextInput.vue` (NEW)**:

  - Created from scratch without VeeValidate.
  - Implements `v-model` using `:value` and `@input`.
  - Introduced `displayPrefix`, `displaySuffix`, and `showFormattedWhenBlurred` props to enable intelligent formatting.
  - Includes `handleFocus` and `handleBlur` methods to toggle between raw and formatted display, and automatically select text on focus.
  - Ensures a space character is added before `displaySuffix` for correct formatting (e.g., "200 см").

- **`assets/vue/components/pages/calculator/CalculatorSelectInput.vue` (NEW)**:

  - Created from scratch without VeeValidate.
  - Implements `v-model` using `:value` and `@change`.

- **`assets/vue/components/pages/calculator/CalculatorCheckboxInput.vue` (NEW)**:
  - Created from scratch without VeeValidate.
  - Implements `v-model` using `:checked` and `@change`.

## Conclusion:

The cargo calculator now features robust state management, allowing seamless transitions between individual and total cargo modes, and preserving data across place tabs. The user experience is significantly enhanced with a quantity counter system and detailed calculation breakdowns, alongside intelligent input field formatting. The removal of VeeValidate from these specific calculator components simplified the code and resolved persistent display issues.
