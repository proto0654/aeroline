## Modal System Status
- **ModalManager**: Single unified system for all modals
- **Structure**: All modals use DaisyUI div-based structure
- **Behavior**: Consistent close on Escape, backdrop click, close buttons
- **Sizes**: Support for small, default, large, full sizes
- **Pages Updated**: 
  - ✅ index.html (become client modal)
  - ✅ profile.html (password/email change modals)
  - ✅ news.html (news detail modal)
  - ✅ service-acts.html (email sending modal)
  - ✅ senders-receivers.html (create/edit/delete modals)

## JavaScript Modules Status
- ✅ modal-manager.js: New unified modal system
- ✅ home-page.js: Updated to use ModalManager
- ✅ news-page.js: Updated to use ModalManager
- ✅ service-acts-page.js: Updated to use ModalManager + fixed click handler
- ✅ senders-receivers-page.js: Completely rewritten for ModalManager
- ✅ main.js: Imports and exposes modalManager globally
- ❌ DELETED: modal.js, modal2.js (old systems)

## Next Steps
- Monitor for any remaining modal-related issues
- Consider adding more modal features if needed (animations, custom callbacks)
- Continue with other project features
- Ensure all new pages use the unified modal system
- ✅ Continue styling and refining UI components, such as the V-Calendar.

## Active Decisions
- All modals MUST use ModalManager and DaisyUI structure
- No more dialog elements - only div-based modals
- Consistent behavior across all modal windows
- Global modalManager available on window object
- All menu items must have a page
- Mobile menu must match design exactly
- Use Tailwind utilities instead of custom CSS
- Keep table sorting functionality in headers only

## Current Considerations
- Modal system is now fully unified and consistent
- All import errors resolved
- All functionality tested and working
- ✅ Styling for V-Calendar date selection has been updated and improved.
- Ready for new features or bug fixes

## UI/Frontend Structure
- All pages use partials for header, footer, and modal (Handlebars)
- Main sections (carousel, forms, cards, map, news, etc.) are rendered via template variables
- Profile page: two columns (user data, account details), modal popups for password/email change via JS
- Navigation: two-level, mobile menu with accordion logic
- Universal modal container using DaisyUI is included on every page
- All forms with phone input use PhoneValidator (mask +7/8, validation on blur, no input lock)
- Service acts page uses List.js for sorting and pagination with Tailwind utilities
- Modal system uses DaisyUI components with custom manager for unified behavior
